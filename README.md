## Feedback Overlay

A Chrome browser extension built using React. Used to display user feedback in an overlay on Dotdash sites. Built as a tool for internal use.

Settings allow you to enable the overlay on specific sites, select a limited range of dates to show feedback from, or hide the overlay entirely.

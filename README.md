## Feedback Overlay

A chrome extension built in react. Used to display user feedback in an overlay on Dotdash sites. Built for internal use, with production URLs removed.

Settings allow you to enable the overlay on specific sites, select a limited range of dates to show feedback from, or hide the overlay entirely.
